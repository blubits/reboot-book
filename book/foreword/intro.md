title: Introduction to computer science
---

The biggest revolution in the past century has arguably been the invention of the computer. Countless discoveries across a variety of fields have been made because of it, and we had to develop a whole new field - ==computer science== - to learn how to harness its power.

At its core, however, computer science is really about solving problems. Despite everything that it has already achieved, the computer is still, to an extent, dumb. On its own, the computer can only manipulate ones and zeroes, small bursts of electricity that run through its chips. It's you, the problem solver, who needs to come up with ways on how to creatively use the computer to solve problems.

And it's not as easy as you think. Computer science requires a way of thinking about the world and the problems within it that is systematic, mathematical, and analytical. A good computer scientist can effectively model, process, and analyze a certain problem, using the tools they have at hand to come up with an elegant solution.

You probably decided to do this course because computer science in high school was one of your favorite subjects. Or maybe you're just interested in computers in general, and you want to master it. Before we get too deep into the subject matter, however, be warned: the journey through CS is **not** an easy feat. It requires practice, discipline, and the courage to master your greatest fear: math. But the effort is ultimately rewarding. If there's one thing we hope you get from this course, it's not how to master the computer; it's how to grasp a problem and come up with an effective solution.

I *really* hope you're still here.

If so, welcome to Introduction to Computer Science and Informatics, a (mostly) self-paced course offered by us, the organizers of Reboot, the Main Campus's official competitive programming team. The course is designed to train you to become an effective computer scientist and problem solver.

We're going to be touring you through the models, paradigms, and algorithms that mathematicians and computer scientists have come up with to solve problems, with the hope that you'll have a repository of tools to use should you encounter your own. With this in mind, the course has been divided into 8 modules.

Here we emphasize *modules*, not *chapters*, because we don't expect you to go through this in a linear fashion. Some of you might be completely new to computer science, while others might already know what a "directed acyclic graph" is this early on. So feel free to take the course in any way you'd like, though we do suggest you avoid skipping through modules or reading up on topics that need concepts you don't quite grasp yet. We'll be detailing the course structure and modules in the next page.

We do hope we didn't scare you that much firsthand. Believe me, while computer science is tiring, at the end of it all it's fun and rewarding to know you've conqured a problem. We live in a society that deals with increasingly more complex problems, and in our opinion, it's essential that you at least know how to wade through all of them. So have fun and don't get lost along the way!
